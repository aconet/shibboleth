Howto: Install/configure shibboleth with apache
-----------------------------------------------

The official installation guide for installing shibboleth with apache on windows can be found there:
https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/SHIB2/NativeSPWindowsApacheInstaller

In this howto we provide a documentation of the steps with which we were successful. You probably
don't need that, if you follow the above documentation.

This guide is based on 

- Windows 7, 32bit
- xampp 1.7.3. Xampp has been installed already in the folder C:\xampp\
- Shibboleth version 2.3.1
