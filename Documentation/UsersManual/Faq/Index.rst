**When I am logged in to the TYPO3 backend and hit the "Logout" button, the page just reloads and I am still logged in.**

This behavior is expected, as logging out from TYPO3 does not end your Shibboleth session. However, there is a
work-around available that would redirect you away from the TYPO3 backend immediately after logout. Please contact
your TYPO3 administrator.
